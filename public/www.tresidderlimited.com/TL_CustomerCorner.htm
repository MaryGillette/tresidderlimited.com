<p class="style6">The most common questions from Customers are &quot;What is the Enhancement Plan? Why do we need it?&quot; </p>
<p class="style6">The answer is, &quot;The enhancement plan is a vital component of your Dynamics system, and an invaluable resource for your employees.&quot;</p>

    <br>
  </li>

    <br>
</li>
  <li><STRONG>Investment protection (formerly transformational assurance):</STRONG> An   existing benefit that is highly valued but not known to all customers. This is   the ability for a customer to move to the future converged Microsoft Dynamics   solution without having to repurchase the functionality they already license   today.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><STRONG>Protected list price:</STRONG> Protected list price helps customers   budget more predictably for their Enhancement Plan renewal year after year,   enabling customers to protect their system list price as the basis of future   renewals. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><STRONG>Transition investment credit:</STRONG> This is a new benefit for all   Microsoft Dynamics financial management and supply chain management customers,   giving them the flexibility and security in their Microsoft Dynamics solution   choice, knowing that if their needs change &ndash; they have access to any of the   other Microsoft Dynamics solutions that best fit their needs. Customers can   apply the full license credit of their Microsoft Dynamics financial management   and supply chain management license investment towards a move to any other   Microsoft Dynamics financial management and supply chain management solution,   such as moving from Microsoft Dynamics NAV to Microsoft Dynamics AX. Or a   customer can move from one package to another (Standard to Professional) within   a product family, if they are using the same packaging method.<br>
